# Physical Human Robot Interaction

Minimal implementations of teleoperation architectures. The project contains the architectures developed during the course Physical Human Robot Interaction at University of Verona.

The following architectures are implemented in Matlab Simulink using a simple 1DOF robot for both master and slave side:

- Four channel teleoperation architecture
- Scattering based teleoperation architecture
- Two-layer teleoperation architecture

A minimal report is provided in [doc](./doc/report.pdf)
